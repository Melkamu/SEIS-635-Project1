It is a simple computer card game. It is very easy for users to learn the game, and improve their memory.


### Guess What, Rules and Instructions:

1. The game uses only 52 cards with out the two jocker cards. Jack is considered 11, Queen is counted as
12 and King signifies the 13th position
2. The system shuffles the cards and cuts the deck into 1-4 groups of 13 cards each. All the cards must be face down
3. The Player is given one to three of the decks for playing and they can look at the deck as long as they need without changing the position
of the cards
4. When they are done memorizing, the player asks for the dealing deck and deals a random card
5. Then they guess what card is placed in the location of the position referenced by the card that is dealed
6. If they guessed right, they win.
7. Players can have many tries depending on the number of playing decks selected. For example if they select only
One playing deck, then they can have 13 tries. For two decks and 1 player they can have 26 tries.
